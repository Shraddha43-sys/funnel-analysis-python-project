# EdTech Funnel Analysis
This project analyzes user engagement and course completion data for an EdTech platform. 
It visualizes the learning funnel, identifies bottleneck stages, and provides insights 
to improve user retention and course completion rates.
**Dataset:** [online_course_engagement_data.csv  ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-course-engagement-dataset?utm_source)
Contains user-level course engagement data including:
- UserID
- CourseCategory
- DeviceType
- TimeSpentOnCourse
- NumberOfVideosWatched
- NumberOfQuizzesTaken
- QuizScores
- CourseCompletion

**Tools & Libraries Used:**
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Matplotlib

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Funnel Stages Creation:
   - Visited
   - Engaged
   - Active Learner
   - Achiever
   - Completed
3. Overall Funnel Analysis
4. DeviceType Segmentation Analysis
5. CourseCategory Segmentation Analysis
6. Visualization:
   - Interactive funnel charts (Plotly)
   - Bar charts (Matplotlib)
7. Key Insights & Recommendations

- Major drop-offs occur in the Achiever → Completed stage.
- DeviceType and CourseCategory segmentation shows bottleneck stages vary by segment.
- Recommendations:
   - Target high drop-off stages with notifications, incentives, or content improvements.
   - Focus on Achiever → Completed stage for maximum impact.
