Student Funnel Analysis – Data Cleaning, Merging &amp; Funnel Conversion using Python
🎓 Student Funnel Analysis Using Python

A complete end-to-end data cleaning, merging, transformation and funnel analysis project using Python.
This project demonstrates how to analyze a student learning journey from registration → activity → assessment → outcome using data engineering + analysis techniques.

This is an end-to-end Python project where we analyze a student’s learning funnel 
from registration → activity → assessment → final outcome.

We clean datasets, merge them, build a unified table, and analyze conversion rates 
using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### 📂 Datasets Used
- registration.csv – student signup info
- student_vle.csv – student online activity
- assessment.csv – quiz/exam results
### 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Combining + merging datasets  
4. Creating final clean master table  
5. Building funnel stages  
6. Data analysis & visualization

### 🔍 Funnel Stages Defined
1. Registration → Student signs up
2. Active Learning → Watching videos / reading course material
3. Assessment → Student attempts quizzes or exams
4. Conversion → Student completes the course / passes assessment

   ### 📊 Key Insights
- Around 65% students who registered actually became active learners.
- Out of all active learners, only 40% reached assessments.
- Final conversion rate (Registration → Passed Assessment) was around 22%.
- Highest drop-off happened between Activity → Assessment stage.

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to merge multiple CSV files  
- How to create a master table  
- How to build funnel metrics  
- How to visualize funnel drop-offs  
- How to communicate insights like a data analyst
